It should have properties for the amount of food, attention, and rest it currently has.

There should be a main page displaying the names of all your Tamagotchi objects with the values of their properties.

Create buttons to call methods to:

Feed it, play with it, and put it to sleep. 

These methods should modify the properties of a single Tamagotchi object â€” such as a food property.

Make time pass. Every time you press it, the food, happiness and sleep properties of all Tamagotchis should decrease.

If any of these properties get to 0, the Tamagotchi object should report that it's dead.

At the very least, this app should include RESTful Index, New, Create, and Show routes.
